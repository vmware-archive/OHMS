## Overview, how to build and run

## License
OHMS is licensed under the Apache versions 2 license, see the file [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) for information about licences for OHMS and its dependencies.

## How to Contribute
NOTE: If you do decide to implement code changes and contribute them, please make sure you agree your contribution can be made available under the Apache version 2 license.  If you update an existing files, don’t add another copy of the Apache license hearer and don’t change existing copyright lines from other copyright holders. You may add additional copyright lines.

OHMS uses github’s pull-request process, documented here:
   https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/

The pull-request approach allows for individual repos to adjust things to fit the nature of the project.  Here’s the policies adopted by OHMS to help track reporting and completion of code requests:
* Do not submit pull requests against the master branch. Use the development branch for most pull-requests
* The motivation for new code should be explained in a bug or enhancement request (a github issue with a label that indicates bug or enhancement). Writing a bug or enhancement issue does not commit you to implementing the related code, but we welcome your contributions to address the issues.
* If bug or enhancement request is sufficiently complex, the work should be broken into multiple tasks (github issues with a task label) that explain the scope of work
* If you are planning to write code, please assign related issues to yourself
* Pull requests should reference the issues (bugs, enhancement, tasks) that explain the motivation and scope of work

### OHMS merge team
The merge team is made up of a few OHMS key developers who have permissions to merge pull requests. Base on availability and expertise, the members of the merge team will decide who will review and approve each pull request.
### Code Reviews
OHMS code is reviewed using github: reviewers comment on pull-requests.  Reviewers must be crystal clear in review comments if they believe an issue must be addressed before code is merged. The merge team member(s) assigned to the review will consider “must address” review comments and work with submitter and reviewer to resolve the issue.  Resolutions may include updates to the pull request, or the reviewer creating a bug report (issue) requesting the issue be addressed in a separate Pull Request.
