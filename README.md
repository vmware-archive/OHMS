### OHMS merge team
The merge team is made up of a few OHMS key developers who have permissions to merge pull requests. Base on availability and expertise, the members of the merge team will decide who will review and approve each pull request.
### Code Reviews
OHMS code is reviewed using github reviewers comments on pull-requests(PR).  Reviewers must be crystal clear in review comments if they believe an issue must be addressed before the code is merged. The merge team member(s) assigned to the PR will consider “must address” review comments and work with submitter and reviewer to resolve the issue.  Resolutions may include updates to the PR, or the reviewer creating a bug report (issue) requesting the issue to be addressed in a separate PR.
